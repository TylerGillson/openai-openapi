# OpenAPI spec for the OpenAI API

This repository contains an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification for the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs), as well as a script that uses [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to auto-generate client SDKs from the specification.

OpenAPI Generator uses [mustache templates](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources) to generate code â€” the files in the `sdk-template-overrides` folder override the corresponding built-in template files with small edits required for the OpenAI SDKs. More detail on each currently generated SDK is provided below.

## Node.js

#### Example command to generate the SDK

```bash
$ python scripts/generate_sdk.py -s node -o ~/openai-node
```

#### Node.js specific details

- The `operationId` of each operation is used as the function name for that operation
- The `tag` determines the name of the Javascript class that contains that operation
- `schema` names map to Typescript type names

## Protocol Buffers

### Example command to generate the OpenAI gRPC service (`openai.proto`)

```bash
# Install earthly (if you haven't already)
# brew install earthly && earthly bootstrap
$ earthly +proto
```

### Example command to generate go gRPC stubs from the gRPC service
```bash
$ earthly +go-gen
# go stubs are regenerated: gen/golang/openai/openai-openapi/proto/openai.pb.go
```
